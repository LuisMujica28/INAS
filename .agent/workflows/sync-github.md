Whenever you make changes to your files and want them to appear on GitHub:

1. Open your terminal in the project folder:
   `cd C:\Users\USER\Documents\INAS_REDESIGN` (or your project path)

2. Add all changes:
   `git add .`

3. Save the changes with a description:
   `git commit -m "Describe what you changed here"`

4. Upload (Push) to GitHub:
   `git push origin main`

Success! Your GitHub repository and linked GitHub Pages site will update automatically in a few minutes.
